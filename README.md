## What we are looking for

- **Simple, clear, readable code** How well structured it is? Clear separation of concerns? Can anyone just look at it and get the idea to
what is being done? Does it follow any standards?
- **Correctness** Does the application do what it promises? Can we find bugs or trivial flaws?
- **Testing** How well tested your application is? Can you give some metrics?


## Questions & Delivery

If you have any questions to this challenge, please do reach out to us.

The challenge should be delivered as a link to a public git repository (github.com or bitbucket.com are preferred).

## Checklist

Before submitting, make sure that your program

- [ ] Uses the endpoint directly

## Note

Implementations focusing on **quality over feature completeness** will be highly appreciated,  donâ€™t feel compelled to implement everything and even if you are not able to complete the challenge, please do submit it anyways.
